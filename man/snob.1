.SH "NAME"
\fBsnob\fR \- snmp network object browser
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsnob\fR [OPTIONS] [HOST]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsnob\fR uses the snmpwalk utility to browse MIB objects on snmp\-enabled devices, such as, switches, routers, servers, etc\.
.
.P
This utility is written specifically for snmp version 3 because of its security features\. Backwards compatibility to version 2c is not included at this time\. Sorry:(\.
.
.P
The special \fB\-\-list\fR switch is included to provide easily remembered names for 1\.0\.8802\.1\.1\.2\.1\.4\.1\.1\.9 or ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress or other cryptic looking OIDs\.
.
.P
The output is raw by default\. In addition, a \-\-dump option is included for dumping the resulting output to a file, raw_dump\.txt, for later perusal\. A \-\-format option exists in an attempt to pretty\-print the output for display on screen\. The \-\-only\-values flag allows output to be used raw by another application like RRDTool for graphing trends when you know which OID you want\.
.
