== name
snobrc.yml - snob configuration file

== synopsis
The configuration file is YAML format and can be edited manually.

== description
A first run will create a default YAML config file named _.snob/snobrc.yml_.
The directory's permissions are set to 0o700 (drwx------) for added security.
The initial set of credentials is for a host named dummy. Afterwards, if the
host is not in the config file, you will be asked to enter credentials manually
with the option to save them.
